# Project Overview
# Task
Execute dummy authentication using api given at https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth
Make a login ui and a profile page, the login takes only username and password and has a login button.
Take the username and password from the user and then on click of the log in button send a post request at the api given in the link above.
The post request should look like this-
fetch('https://dummyjson.com/auth/login', {
method: 'POST',
headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
body: JSON.stringify({
username:${usernameState},
password:${passwordState},
})
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(console.log);
If the response is 200 OK, then save the token and the id in local storage and send the user to profile page.
Inside the profile page , make a useeffect which sends a fetch request at https://dummyjson.com/users/${id} , where id is the id you saved in local storage.
Save the user object in a useState and display all of the information you receive.
Use any one of the usernames and passwords given below to actually log in and get a successful response, if the response is not 200 OK or successful then show the error provided by the api in the frontend on login.
Dummy Credentials to get a successful response-
Username - atuny0 , Password - 9uQFF1Lh
Username - hbingley1 , password - CQutx25i8r
Username - rshawe2 , password - OWsTbMUgFc
You can get more valid usernames and password from- https://dummyjson.com/users
If its an invalid username or password the login api will automatically show an error.
